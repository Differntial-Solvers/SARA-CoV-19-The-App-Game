# SARA-CoV-19-The-App-Game
Social distancing policies enacted the world over during the COVID-19 pandemic have left many people socially isolated. Your challenge is to develop innovative solutions to combat social isolation.
## Summary
The project is a multi-player video game that contains mini-games form a variety of genres to attract different types of people to play with each other while informing them directly and indirectly of useful information about the Novel Coronavirus.
How We Addressed This Challenge
Our projects address the challenge by making its first priority to connect players with each other to decrease the feeling of fear in this situation and increase players' information about COVID-19.

## How We Developed This Project
Corona has left a lot of damage to the surface of the earth and one of the most important and most dangerous is social isolation, so we found it good to research and try to formulate a solution to this problem As we note that the lack of health awareness about COVID-19 creates a big problem of increasing the mortality of people as a result of the great spreading of COVID-19. Social isolation during corona-virus which is applied as a trial to reduce the spreading of COVID-19. Social isolation caused a lot of problems for people. Unfortunately, the most dangerous side of social isolation is the psychological side. As we explained, we are focusing on creating a game to solve these two main problems â€œsocial isolation & lack of health awareness about COVID-19". The game is an attractive local multiplayer game that helps to increase the unity between the people and helps them to overlook the sense of social isolation. We used an interesting way to show the information and the recommendations about COVID-19 during playing the game. So, the player of this game will be thirsty for more information as he adored this way of presenting the information and the recommendations. So, he will play more and more with his friends, family, and neighbors to discover more extra information and to feel more friendly with others. Therefore, he will forget the effect of social isolation and his health awareness about COVID-19 will increase. This is the way that we followed to develop the game using NASA's data and this is the target of the challenge of social isolation. To develop our project, we use a programming language called C# and we made the design with Unity 3D. We encountered a lot of problems during solving the challenge such as choosing the best logical idea, coding the game, time management, shortage of experience in some fields, and reaching to trusted information about COVID-19 plus social isolation. After we started to solve the problem, we were very confused as there wasn't enough time to think clearly. Depending on what we learned in STEM schools, we followed the "EDP". "EDP" is an abbreviation for the engineering design process. The engineering design process is some organized steps that are very helpful in solving any challenge. we started to benefit from each other such as every member of our team chose a step from the "EDP" to achieve it lonely. Everyone suggested a solution. Then we collected all the solutions and we made an online form and let the people chose the most suitable and enjoyable solution. They chose the idea of the multiplayer game. There wasn't enough time to code the game. After the help of some coders and using the unity 3d program, we could finish the game. We faced a problem with the research part as there is a lot of information about COVID-19 on many websites. We became very confused, which information is true and which is false. Luckily, we could solve this problem by using the World Health Organization website, NASA's data, and NASA's partner agencies for the Space Apps COVID-19 Challenge (ESA, JAXA, CSA, CNES...).These websites have a lot of organized trusted information in a lot of fields that greatly helped us to access what we needed. NASA Space Apps Challenge' YouTube channel was very helpful and provided us with a lot of information that helped us to solve the problems that faced us in our team.
